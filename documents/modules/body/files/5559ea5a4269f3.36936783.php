				<strong><em>Note:</em></strong> <em>Even hold music is better than silence. Avoid muting your phone while you troubleshoot an issue. The customer may think they were disconnected or you may only think that you have the customer on mute and inadvertently make an inappropriate comment that the customer will overhear.</em>
